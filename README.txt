For this assessment I had to do the following:

1. Business Requirements Document containing screen shots of the feature(s) you are testing. 

2. Test Plan consisting of test cases. 

The website I chose to this on was Github.com.


I've sent the businees requirements in both word doc and PDF format in case
the word doc jumbles up the pictures. Both have the same content.

I've sent a test.txt file for the upload file test.
